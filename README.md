📝 Overview
The Phonebook API is a RESTful web service built using Spring Boot to manage phonebook contacts. It supports basic CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The API uses Lombok for simplifying Java code, Flyway for database migrations, and JPA/Hibernate for database interaction. Docker is used to containerize the application and MySQL serves as the database.
